# Excercise 1 : single page application

We need you to build us a small single page application on vuejs to manage class.

## How we want it to work

- If you land on the detail page of an class, we need see its students (with firstname, lastname, ...) and dateofjoining.
- We need to be able to remove a student from the class
- We need to be able to add an new student to the class
- We need to be able to create the class and receive a confirmation message of its success (or failure)

## APIs

In the [class](./class/) directory, you can find a couple of class.
You can assume these are in the format of the real external API.
For now, you can use this dummy data, but make sure we can plug in the real api in easily.

In the [data](./data/) directory, you can find source files for school data and student data, in case you need it.
You can assume these are in the format of the real external API.

To create the class, just log it on the console, but make sure we can plug in the real api endpoint easily.
